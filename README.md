## Basic fixes
<details>

### üîà Audio
Without any modifications, the headphone jack is buggy. External microphones aren't detected and the audio output may randomly stop working or start making weird noises. Sometimes replugging the headphones works, but that's pretty annoying and unreliable. To permanently fix this issue you will have to install [this fork of ComboJack](https://github.com/lvs1974/ComboJack).

### üîã Power management
Hibernation is not supported on a Hackintosh and everything related to it should be completely disabled. Disabling additional features prevents random wakeups while the lid is closed. After every update, these settings should be reapplied manually.

```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo rm -f /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
sudo pmset -a powernap 0
sudo pmset -a proximitywake 0
sudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0 (optional)
```
