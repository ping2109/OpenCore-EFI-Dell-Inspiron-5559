As MacBookPro13,1 (MBP2016) SMBIOS has been dropped on Ventura and later, we have to use the SMBIOS of MacBookPro14,1 (MBP 2017) machine. Which also requires the iGPU to be spoofed as Kabylake, in this case HD 520 to HD 620.

## Basic fixes
<details>

### üîà Audio
Without any modifications, the headphone jack is buggy. External microphones aren't detected and the audio output may randomly stop working or start making weird noises. Sometimes replugging the headphones works, but that's pretty annoying and unreliable. To permanently fix this issue you will have to install [this fork of ComboJack](https://github.com/lvs1974/ComboJack).

### üîã Power management
Hibernation is not supported on a Hackintosh and everything related to it should be completely disabled. Disabling additional features prevents random wakeups while the lid is closed. After every update, these settings should be reapplied manually.

```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo rm -f /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
sudo pmset -a powernap 0
sudo pmset -a proximitywake 0
sudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0 (optional)
```

## AirPort wireless card
<details>
To get full Continuity Suite, I highly suggest spending an extra $15 for a Wireless card mod, which can be done with two components
- A BCM943602CS2 AirPort card (found in 2011 to 2017 MBAs)
- An NGFF Key A+E adapter

To get the card to fit, you'll have to cut off the H3 screw mount of the adapter and part of the laptop's bottom casing (marked red in the photo).
The antenna cables also have to be routed as marked green in the photo below.
